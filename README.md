# Linux MCSR
- A documentation repository to help setting up Linux for MCSR. This is a fork of the original guide by [Sathya](https://github.com/xyroah) for setting up mcsr on mint instead of fedora. 

# Getting Started
- Mint offers a smoother and easier experience for setup compared to fedora as a new user.
- The instructions start from the very basics and explain each step verbosely. Feel free to skip some steps if you know what you are doing.
- You can get started right [here](https://xyroah.io/linux-mcsr).
